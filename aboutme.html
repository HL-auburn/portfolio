			<h2>My story about teaching and learning</h2>
			<p>In the past, I have read thousands of stories from books and heard from people, and none of them is similar to the others. My story is different as well.
			<p>I started my teaching journey by chance. When I was a sophomore at a university in 2012 back in China, I was invited to help tutor a high school student who had difficulties learning English. I had complex feelings about that experience. In the beginning, although I was confident about my teaching, I felt challenged because the student was not interested in this subject.  Then, I changed my idea from preaching to inciting her interest. I introduced my favorite English books, songs, and movies to her. Moreover, I supported and encouraged her both in her English study and in her life. Eventually, her English improved after 3 months of effort. The appreciation and gratefulness from my student and her parents showed me and gave me a sense of achievement.</p>
<p>Although I didn't keep teaching due to various reasons, I returned and found a passion for teaching English and Chinese. After graduation, I worked as an assistant for a manager and was then promoted to the secretary of the president of a trading company. Although I got a promotion, I realized that was not where my passion was. I resigned from the position and kept exploring a career in a different field. I was lucky that I found my love in the winter of 2017, teaching English! I was invited to help a friend teach one class at her English Training school, where K12 students learn English by speaking English. I was thrilled when my students learned to speak English quickly in my class. It echoes my tutoring experience a few years ago and reminds me of some beautiful memories.  Since then, I planned to be a teacher in the future.</p>
